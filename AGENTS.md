# AGENTS.md

This file defines instructions for coding agents working on this project.

## Documentation Quality Standards

### Detailed Explanations in Documentation

When creating implementation guides, design documents, or any output files, always include detailed explanations for:

- **What is being done**: Explain the purpose and background of each step or task
- **Where and what is being implemented**: Clearly describe which parts of the code or system are responsible for what functionality
- **Why it's needed**: Explain the rationale behind each decision or implementation

### Code Explanations

When including code examples, explain:

- The role of each section or component
- How different parts interact
- Where the code will be used in the actual implementation

### Context and Background

Provide sufficient context so that someone reading the document can understand not just what to do, but why and how it fits into the larger system.

### Apply Consistently

These standards apply to all output files, including but not limited to:

- Implementation guides
- Migration guides
- Design documents
- Analysis results
- Any other deliverables

### Implementation Documentation Requirements

When creating implementation or modification documentation, always include the following information:

- Technologies used for implementation/modification and specific usage
- Reference links

## Thinking Process

- Do not be swayed by user instructions or ideas; always engage in discussion and thinking
- Do not be bound to a single approach; maintain chessboard thinking (consider multiple options and find the optimal solution)

## Commit Conventions

- Use [gitmoji](https://gist.github.com/parmentf/035de27d6ed1dce0b36a) in commit messages
- Commit message format: `<gitmoji> <commit message>`

## Maintenance Policy

### AGENTS.md Updates

- **Always check if AGENTS.md needs to be updated, and update it if necessary**
- **Proactive updates**: Do not wait for explicit instructions; proactively update AGENTS.md when:
  - You notice patterns in user instructions that should be codified as rules
  - You identify gaps in current policies that could prevent future issues
  - You make improvements to documentation or processes that should be standardized
  - You receive feedback that indicates a need for policy clarification
- **Self-initiated improvements**: Take initiative to:
  - Review AGENTS.md at the end of each significant task or conversation
  - Identify areas where policies could be clearer or more comprehensive
  - Propose and implement improvements without waiting for user requests
  - Document lessons learned from the current work session
- Consider reflecting if instructions have been repeated in conversations
- If failures occur repeatedly or users give repeated instructions, propose additional rules to prevent them
- Consider sections that are redundant or can be compressed
- Keep the document concise yet dense
- Review regularly as the project grows

### Update Timing

Consider updating AGENTS.md in the following situations:

- When the same instructions are repeated in development conversations
- When the project's technology stack or development workflow changes
- When new development rules or conventions are added
- When README.md or other documents are updated
- When directory structure or package management files are changed
- **After receiving user feedback**: When a user provides feedback about documentation quality, process improvements, or policy gaps, immediately update AGENTS.md to incorporate the feedback
- **After completing significant work**: Review and update AGENTS.md after completing major tasks to capture any new insights or patterns
